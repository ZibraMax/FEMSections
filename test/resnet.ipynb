    "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. Residual learning was introduced to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. ResNet explicitly reformulates the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. On the ImageNet dataset this method was evaluated with residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. This technique can also be applied to the CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. \n",

Some types of neural network can be implemented in either, such as dense feedforward neural networks (like we used for the Iris and MPG datasets).  However, other types of neural network, like ResNet and GANs can only be used in the Functional Model API.\n",
